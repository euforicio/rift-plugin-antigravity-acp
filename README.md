# rift-plugin-google-antigravity-acp

Google Antigravity as a first-class rift agent provider through Antigravity's
official **ACP** server (`agy_acp_server.par`).

Registers the `acp-antigravity` provider (family `acp`), exactly like rift's
builtin ACP agents:

- `server.ts` — `rift.providers.register` with the launch spec in
  `experimental_bridgeOptions.acpLaunchSpec`; plugin settings for install
  paths; the `rift google-antigravity-acp status` and
  `rift google-antigravity-acp install` commands.
- `host.ts` — re-exports the canonical ACP provider bridge
  (`@riftlabs/plugin-sdk/provider-bridge/acp`, the same bridge the builtin
  `provider-acp` plugin uses) and implements the host RPC the install/status
  commands call, so installs run on the target machine, not on the rift server.
- `install.ts` — shared install logic: resolves the official distribution
  from the ACP registry (pinned to a commit SHA), downloads, safely extracts,
  and links the server binary and sandbox helper onto PATH (no environment
  variables needed).
- `icons/google-antigravity.svg` — provider mark (path-shaped, theme-tinted).

## Install the plugin

```sh
rift plugin install .                  # from this directory
rift plugin reload google-antigravity-acp
```

## Install the server binary

```sh
rift google-antigravity-acp install
```

The command runs on the machine that will launch the agent (the current
thread's host, or `--machine <id-or-name>` to pick another enrolled machine):

- detects the platform/arch and takes the official zip URL for it from the
  ACP registry (`agentclientprotocol/registry` → `antigravity-acp`, pinned to
  `REGISTRY_COMMIT` in `install.ts`), falling back to a pinned copy embedded
  in the plugin;
- downloads and extracts into `~/.local/opt/agy-acp-server` (configurable via
  `--install-dir`, or the `installDir` plugin setting). Extraction never uses
  `tar` (bsdtar does not sanitize `../` zip entries); it uses `unzip` or a
  validated `python3` zipfile extraction, and PowerShell's `Expand-Archive`
  on Windows;
- symlinks `agy_acp_server.par` and its sandbox helper `localharness_external`
  into `~/.local/bin` (configurable via `--bin-dir` / `binDir`); on Windows it
  copies them and only appends the dir to the user PATH when you pass
  `--update-path` (setx permanently edits `HKCU\Environment` — opt in
  explicitly, and be aware of its 1024-character truncation limit);
- makes the binaries executable and records the install in a manifest.

Install once per machine that should run Antigravity threads. The provider
only appears on a machine where the health probe finds `agy_acp_server.par`
on PATH; the ACP server finds the sandbox helper on PATH too (the install
links both into `binDir`), so no per-machine environment variables are
needed.

```sh
rift google-antigravity-acp install --machine macbook        # this machine
rift google-antigravity-acp install --machine other-host     # another enrolled machine
```

The machine's daemon shell must have `binDir` on PATH. The command warns
when it is not; pick a dir that is (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`) with `--bin-dir`.

Useful flags:

```sh
rift google-antigravity-acp install --machine macbook        # install on a specific machine
rift google-antigravity-acp install --force                  # re-download even if already installed
rift google-antigravity-acp install --from ./agy-acp.zip     # explicit source (URL or local file)
rift google-antigravity-acp install --update-path            # also append binDir to the user PATH (Windows)
rift google-antigravity-acp install --json                   # machine-readable output
```

`~/.local/bin` must be on the machine's PATH for the provider health probe to
find the server. The command warns when it is not.

## Verify

```sh
rift google-antigravity-acp status        # where the server is, per machine
rift provider list                        # acp-antigravity appears (visibility: installed)
rift provider models acp-antigravity
rift thread spawn --provider acp-antigravity --prompt 'hi'
```

## Security notes

- The ACP registry is fetched from a **pinned commit** (`REGISTRY_COMMIT`),
  never from an unpinned branch, so a registry compromise cannot inject an
  arbitrary binary onto PATH.
- The download source is explicit: the pinned registry URL, or an explicit
  `--from` flag. There is no environment-variable redirect.
- Extraction validates archive entries and refuses `../`/absolute paths.
- No code from this plugin executes the downloaded file except impossible —
  the server binary itself (`agy_acp_server.par`), which is Google's official
  release, is what the provider runs.

## Auth

Auth is handled in-band by the ACP server (Google account OAuth, Gemini API
key, Agent Platform). First run surfaces a login flow in the thread. State
lives under `~/.gemini/antigravity-acp/settings.json`.

## Development

Maintained for Rift by Rift Labs ([riftlabs.app](https://riftlabs.app)).
Original upstream authorship and MIT licensing are preserved.

With Node 22, run `node tooling/check-vendor.mjs`, `npm ci --ignore-scripts`,
`npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build`. The builder is actual Rift 0.42.1
build code, with its source ref, checksum, and license in `tooling/vendor`.
SDK archive provenance is in `vendor/README.md`. The SDK stays a production
dependency because the host imports its ACP bridge and host runtime.
There is no upstream automated test suite or frontend entry. Building and
loading the host do not establish authenticated Antigravity runtime acceptance;
use the Verify commands above on a machine with the official binary and auth.
